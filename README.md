Hello.
Goodbye.

I am ATC-112038. I specialise in langauges such as but not limited to: C++, CUDA, Python, Java, MongoDB, GoLang, HTML, CSS and parts of other languages. I am currently working on designing a custom CUDA Kernel, to be incorportated with PyTorch and Tensorflow. I am interested in the field of numerical computing , computational statistics, parallel computing on multiple platforms and much more. 

I am currently working on coputational statistics and data projects, as well computational mathematics. 
My most active development/repository is my Custom Cuda Kernel for sroting nets and deep belief networks.
